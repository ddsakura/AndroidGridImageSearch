Time spent: 6-7 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:
* [x] User can enter a search query that will display a grid of image results from the Google Image API.
* [x] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of advanced search options to filter results
* [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as: Size, Color, Type, Site
* [x] Subsequent searches will have any filters applied to the search results
* [x] User can scroll down “infinitely” to continue loading more image results (up to 8 pages)
* [x] Use the ActionBar SearchView or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
* [x] Improve the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring
* [x] User can tap on any image in results to see the image full-screen
